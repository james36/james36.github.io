<h2><b> Duet Lyrics </b> </h2>
<h4> Written by Mikel Jollett </h4>
<h4> Performed by The Airborne Toxic Event </h4>	
<p> 
I've been away for far too long <br>
I've had my mind wrapped around this one song <br>
I heard last week on the radio while <br>
Driving near that place we used to go <br>

Where the track homes all look the same <br>
With the roofs and the tiles and the similar frames <br>
All these streets are so wide and these cars are so lame <br>
And on every block I heard the whisper of your name <br>

I spent so many evenings in my head <br>
I'd lie alone on an unmade bed <br>
Counting the minutes like numbered clocks <br>
Should I call, should I write, should I read, should I stop? <br>

I'm a child, I'm a ghost, I'm a slur, I'm a boast <br>
I'm a prince, I'm a king, I'm a ryhme, I'm a ring <br>
I'm unable to sleep, I'm unable to sing <br>
I'm a desperate and lonely, frightened, unholy thing <br>

And you'd say la la la I'm so glad I'm over you <br>
As you reach for your drink and you tell me you like my shoes <br>
And I smile like a wretch, there's not much else I can do <br>
I say I know what you mean, yeah it's weird for me too <br>
Besides what would I sing about if I had you? <br>

Kinda sounds like la la la... <br>
La la la... <br>

I think maybe it was Radiohead <br>
That had this weird little beat and a keyboard instead <br>
Of guitar playing chords, I remember how bored <br>
You would get with those bands <br>
You always said they play the same three chords <br>

And you'd dance around in your t-shirt and sing <br>
Don't you love Modest Mouse and adore Promise Ring? <br>
Don't you wish that you could just avoid everything? <br>
Join a band, go on tour, and think of me when you sing? <br>

And I'd think la la la yeah that sounds okay to me <br>
And you'd fall on the bed and I'd fall down to my knees <br>
And I'd smile like my life depended on it <br>
That's so weird I was mostly right about that <br>
Always eager to love and eager to leave <br>

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la... <br>

And I'd think la la la all these songs are so untrue <br>
As I stare at this space inside of you <br>
And we don't belong and it sounds so wrong <br>
And you're beautiful with that gray scarf on <br>

I think yeah okay but maybe it's just the song <br>
And I miss you but it might just be the song </p>
